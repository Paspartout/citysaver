# Citysaver - City screensaver?

Citysaver is a small experimental project of me to learn game or graphics programming in C.

The goal is to have a screensaver simulating city live.
Thanks to Kenny [for his awesome tileset](1).

You can take a look at the [TODO.md](TODO.md) for things I have planned.
